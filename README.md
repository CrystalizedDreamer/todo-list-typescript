This is the initial readme file for the to do list app that will contain all the notes therein.

The application is designed to test my abilities in integrating user authentication via Auth0.

Thankfully I've already tackled a simpler version of this project in Python using a CLI, therefore I think this will be a great chance to do it again with a little bit more.... Panache
