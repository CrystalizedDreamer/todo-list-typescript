This is the initial readme file for the to do list app that will contain all the notes therein.

The application is designed to test my abilities in integrating user authentication via Auth0.

Thankfully I've already tackled a simpler version of this project in Python using a CLI, therefore I think this will be a great chance to do it again with a little bit more.... Panache

Had to refactor code both for modularity and for use of ContextAPI, I really need to read the full instructions before I begin working so that I don't have to refactor later. Note for my future I suppose.

7/15/25 This is the comment update. I decided to go back and comment the code in order to enhance readability and to force me to better interface with my own learning.
